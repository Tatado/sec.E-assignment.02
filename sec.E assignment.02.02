1.
It is the form of learning which requires higher order mental processes like thinking, reasoning, intelligence, etc.
 we learn different concepts from childhood.
 For example, when we see a dog and attach the term 'dog', we learn that the word dog refers to a particular animal.
2.
The three major types of learning described by behavioral psychology are
 classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and observational learning.
upervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning are some equivalents of machine learnings.
3.
Machine Learning is an AI technique that teaches computers to learn from experience.
 Machine learning algorithms use computational methods to “learn” information directly from data without relying on a predetermined equation as a model.
4.
Reinforcement Learning is a feedback-based Machine learning technique 
in which an agent learns to behave in an environment by performing the actions and seeing the results of actions. For each good action,
 the agent gets positive feedback, and for each bad action, the agent gets negative feedback or penalty.
5.
Concept Learning as Search:  Concept learning can be viewed as the task of searching
 through a large space of hypothesis implicitly define by the hypothesis representation. 
 The goal of the concept learning search is to find the hypothesis that best fits the training examples.
6.
Humans acquire knowledge through experience either directly or shared by others.
 Machines acquire knowledge through experience shared in the form of past data. 
 Terms, Knowledge, Skill, and Memory being used to define intelligence
Just because  havimg good memory, that does not mean to be  intelligent.
7.
There is some examples
Image recognition. Image recognition is a well-known and widespread example of machine learning in the real world. ...
Speech recognition. ...
Medical diagnosis. ...
Statistical arbitrage. ...
Predictive analytics. ...
Extraction.

Making coffee with a coffee machine is a good example of abstraction. To know how to use your coffee machine to make coffee.
 wee need to provide water and coffee beans, switch it on and select the kind of coffee you want to get.
9.
A model's ability to generalize is central to the success of a model. If a model has been trained too well on training data, it will be unable to generalize. 
It will make inaccurate predictions when given new data, making the model useless even though it is able to make accurate predictions for the training data.

Regression Algorithm	
In Regression, we find the best fit line 
that can predict the output accurately.
                                                                                                                                      
 Classification Algorithm
In Classification, we find the decision boundary
 that can divide the dataset into different classes.
10.
Formulating a regression analysis helps you predict the effects of the independent variable on the dependent one.
 Example: we can say that age and height can be described using a linear regression model.
 Since a person's height increases as its age increases, they have a linear relationship.
11.
K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters.
 Here K defines the number of pre-defined clusters that need to be created in the process,
 as if K=2, there will be two clusters, and for K=3, there will be three clusters, and so on.
12.
i.At its most basic, machine learning uses programmed algorithms that receive and analyse input data to predict output values within an acceptable range. 
As new data is fed to these algorithms, they learn and optimise their operations to improve performance, developing 'intelligence' over time.
ii.Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. 
These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention.
